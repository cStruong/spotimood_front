# SpotiMood 
SpotiMood is a web application that allows users to create a playlist that is pre-filled based on their mood and genre preferences whose UI is modeled and inspired by Spotify and built using React.js with a Ruby on Rails [backend](https://github.com/cStruong/spotimood_back) API.

## Introduction
SpotiMood is our Module 4 paired project where we were first introduced to the React library to build a Single Page Application on a  "virtual" DOM. 

SpotiMood is a web application that allows users to create a playlist that is pre-filled based on their mood and genre preferences whose UI is modeled and inspired by Spotify. Playlist comes with pre-filled songs seeded from a database. Each song card contains song information along with an embedded youtube video.
